#+TITLE TODO's

* DONE First run repo initialization
  CLOSED: [2016-10-15 Sat 15:47]

* TODO Move all URL's to github

* TODO Rework Test's
Test should only handle input's and output's. Many of the test's right now
simple invoke function's and test for go error's.

We should make it so that the Test's are testing input's and output's
