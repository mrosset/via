#+TITLE TODO's

* TODO Find way to host packages via http
* TODO Rework Test's
Test should only handle input's and output's. Many of the test's right now
simple invoke function's and test for go error's.

We should make it so that the Test's are testing input's and output's

* TODO When packaging check PREFIX is honored
