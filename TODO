TODO
========

Via
-------
1. fix stage to be sane and hookable
2. install common licenses for each package
3. go through core and check licenses/patches


Staging
--------
Files are decompressed into $cache/stage. Most packages use autotools,
 and support VPATH, this means we can build most packages in a clean Dir

Instead of caching stages and builds. Clean both build
and stage dir after successful build?

Stager variable can be used to override staging.

# ex: filetype=markdown
